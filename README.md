# supa-space PandeMic-InvaderS

This is a first frontend project focused on emulating the mythical game "space invaders" adapting it to this new era that we have had to live.😷

For the creation of this project, the video tutorial  **HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript Space Invaders Game Tutorial** of Chris Courses has been followed. You can visit it at the following link: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVU0w73uKI

The goal of this project has been to learn how to adapt from a single file code to a more structured one with files and folders to better distinguish the functions and classes that are executed and to incorporate new functionalities not described in the original video tutorial ([See Extra Features](#extra--features)).
