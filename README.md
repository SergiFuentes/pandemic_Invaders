# supa-space PandeMic-InvaderS

This is a first frontend project focused on emulating the mythical game "space invaders" adapting it to this new era that we have had to live.😷

For the creation of this project, the video tutorial  **HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript Space Invaders Game Tutorial** of Chris Courses has been followed. You can visit it at the following link: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVU0w73uKI

The goal of this project has been to learn how to adapt from a single file code to a more structured one with files and folders to better distinguish the functions and classes that are executed and to incorporate new functionalities not described in the original video tutorial (See Extra Features).

- Ambiental music

- Starting screen

- Game over / Retry? screen

- Play-pause button
